# Type of Issue : 
	New program ?
	  --or--
	New module ?

# For New Programs : 

	Identify what file inputs are.

	What is the workflow supposed to do ? (answer a question , vizualize a result , transform data ?)

	How will it function: Completely (and succinctly) describe the process by which data will be processed and analyzed.

	If some functionality already exsits within the luddite package - identify it explicitly. 

	If funcionality is NEEDED , describe it.


# For new modules :
	
	Identify what the module is supposed to do. (i.e. provide methods for clustering , provide interface to program 'X')

	Identify what program/workflow this module is needed for, or do a damn good job justifing its creation.

	Identify dependencies.

	Identify inputs.
